 abstract = {The MIMIC Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) Database v1.0.0 is a large publicly available dataset of chest radiographs with structured labels. The dataset contains 371,920 images corresponding to 224,548 radiographic studies performed at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA. The dataset is de-identified to satisfy the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Safe Harbor requirements. Protected health information (PHI) has been removed. The dataset is intended to support a wide body of research in medicine including image understanding, natural language processing, and decision support.},

This script is designed to load local images on a server stored in the structure defined by the Dataset creators.
The script should also combine text with the images to allow the training of a image text stable diffusion model
